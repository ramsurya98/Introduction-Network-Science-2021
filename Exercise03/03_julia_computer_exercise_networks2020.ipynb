    "If the structure of a network is known, i.e., if we know its topology, how many nodes there are and how they are connected, it is possible to calculate a variety of quantities or measures that describe certain concepts of the network topology. One of those concepts are *network centralities* which assign each node (or edge) in the network a certain value according to some their \"importance\". The most straightforward centrality is the degree centrality which assigns each node a value according to their degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other centralities but in this exercise we focus on the*edge betweenes centrality*, which will allow us to detect communities in a network. \n",
    "\n",
    "A*community* is a set of nodes in a network that can be grouped into a set of preferential attachments to other nodes in the network. Maybe one of the most famous example where we can study communities is [*Zachary's Karate Club*](), which is discussed in delay in this paper by [Girvan & Newman](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0112110.pdf), whose algorithm we will try to implement here."

    "The betweeness centrality $g(v)$ of node $v$ is defined via the number of all shortest paths $\\sigma_{st}(v)$ from node $s$ to node $t$ through node $v$ divided by the number of all shortest paths in the graph $\\sigma_{st}$ from $s$ to $t$.\n",

This property can be useful to determine a profitable location for a new shop in a city network for instance. In this exercise we will use it different, however.

Thus, the edges which connect two communities will have a high edge betweenness. By succesively removing edges with the highest edge betweenes and checking if the network is still globally connected we can thus detect communities. This is known as the *Girvan-Newman algorithm*.\n",

If you want to stick with LightGraphs you will have to implement a function by yourself. Otherwise give networkX a try! You can do so with \"using PyCall; nx = pyimport(\"networkx\")\"\n",
    "1. Design a method to identify the edge with the highest edge betweenness.\n",
    "2. Remove this edge and iterate 1.-2.\n",
    "3. Design a stop condition that stops when you obtain two disconnected components.\n",
    "4. Test your algorithm on the famous Zachary's Katare Club. You can get the network with `G = nx.karate_club_graph()` (networkX) or `G = smallgraph(:karate)` (LightGraphs)."
